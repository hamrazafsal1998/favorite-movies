      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        My love for cinema stems from its unique power to transport us into other worlds and
        perspectives. A great film is more than just entertainment; it's a conversation starter, an
        emotional journey, and a piece of visual art. I enjoy movies that are carefully crafted,
        whether that's a sweeping epic, a tightly written psychological thriller, or a film with
        innovative cinematography.
